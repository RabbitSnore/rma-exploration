# Formal Model

This model draws considerable inspiration from Cramer et al (2016,
10.1371/journal.pone.0167490).

Let us assume that a person's expression of a given myth statement can take some
number of values $k$, where lower values correspond to disagreement with the
myth, higher values correspond to acceptance of the myth, and the central value
(i.e., the median $c$ of the values 0 through $k - 1$) corresponds to a neutral
position toward the myth (e.g., "neither agree nor disagree"). We model
acceptance of myth $i$ at time $t$ as a value $x$ sampled from a binomial
distribution, with $k - 1$ trials with probability $p$ of each trial taking the
value 1, centered such that the median value of 1 through $k$ is 0. For example,
for a 5-point scale, this model creates values from -2 to 2. The following
equation describes these assumptions:

$$
x^t_i = B(k - 1, p^t_i) - c
$$

The probability $p$ for myth $i$ at time $t$ is assumed to result from a
logistic function:

$$
p^t_i = \frac{1}{1 + e^{b_i - A^t_i}}
$$

Here, $b_i$ represents the general tendency for the myth $i$ to be expressed,
and $A$ is the level of activation currently directed toward this myth. Let us
assume that a myth receives activation (or deactivation) from two sources: (1)
the values at the previous time point $t - 1$ of adjacent myths (i.e., myths
connected by an edge in the network model) weighted by the strength of the
connection $W_{ij}$ and (2) their current motivation to express rape myths. The
activation function is defined as follows:

$$
A^t_i = \sum_{j = 1}^J{W_{ij}x^{t-1}_j + m^t}
$$

Values for $b$ can be estimated from empirical means standardized by the number
of scale points (i.e., $\frac{\bar{X}}{k}$) for rape myth acceptance using a
logit transformation:

$$
b_i = -log(\frac{\frac{\bar{X}}{k}}{1 - \frac{\bar{X}}{k}})
$$

Values for $W$ can be estimated from the empirical edge weights $r_{ij}$,
converted from $r$ to log odds and scaled by $k - c - 1$, such that the maximum
amount of activation and deactivation is conferred by maximum and minimum values
respectively:

$$
W_{ij} = \frac{2r_{ij}}{\sqrt{1 - 2r_{ij}}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\pi} \times \frac{1}{k - c - 1}
$$

# Simulation 1: Variations of Connectivity and Motivation

I used the data from Łyś et al (2023) to estimate $b$ and $W$ values.

The first simulation based on the proposed model varied the level of network
connectivity by multiplying the weights by 0.75, 1.00, or 1.25 and the level of
motivation from -0.45 to 0.45 in increments of .15. For each combination of
connectivity and motivation, I simulated 200 people over 50 time points. Each
person's starting values were set by sampling from binomial distributions using
the baseline $b$ values.

The results of this simulation are visualized below.

## (In)stability Over Time

In the following analyses, change over time is measured using the standardized
deviation of each person's sum scores or of item-level ratings across time.

### Sum Scores

Below, we can see that under most conditions, the model reproduces the
empirically observed positive correlation between change over time and sum
scores. However, under conditions of higher motivation, especially with high
connectivity, the correlation is reduced or eliminated, apparently due to the
appearance of a set of people with persistently high sum scores.

```

### Item Ratings

As we can see below, under most conditions, the model reproduces the empirically
observed positive correlation between the overall item mean and change of
ratings over time. However, at high levels of motivation, we see that the
relationship is more complicated: When items have means greater than the
midpoint, we wee that change over time decreases.

# Simulation 2: Changes of Motivation Over Time

In this simulation, I varied the network connectivity at the same levels as the
first simulation and varied motivation across time in three different ways: (1)
rising over time from -0.45 to 0.45, (2) falling over time from 0.45 to -0.45,
and (3) continuously set at 0.30 but sinking momentarily to -1.00 at $t = 25$.

The results of this simulation are displayed below.
